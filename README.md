## üõ†Ô∏è Setup Instructions

### Prerequisites
- Flutter SDK 3.9.2+
- Python 3.8+
- Git

### Frontend Setup

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd scanix_2
   ```

2. **Install Flutter dependencies**:
   ```bash
   flutter pub get
   ```

3. **Run the Flutter app**:
   ```bash
   flutter run
   ```

### Backend Setup

1. **Navigate to backend directory**:
   ```bash
   cd backend
   ```

2. **Create virtual environment**:
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
   ```

3. **Install Python dependencies**:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. **Run the Flask server**:
   ```bash
   python run.py
   ```

The backend will start on `http://localhost:5000`

## üîß Configuration

### Backend Configuration
- Update `baseUrl` in `lib/services/api_service.dart` if running backend on different port
- Modify model parameters in `backend/app.py` for different AI models
- Configure CORS settings for production deployment

### Flutter Configuration
- Update API endpoints in `lib/services/api_service.dart`
- Modify theme colors in `lib/utils/app_theme.dart`
- Add your own assets to `assets/` directories

## üìä API Endpoints

### Image Analysis
- `POST /analyze` - Analyze uploaded image
- `GET /health` - Server health check

### Doctor Management
- `GET /doctors` - List available doctors
- `POST /send-report` - Send analysis to doctor

### Contact & Support
- `POST /contact` - Submit contact form

## üß† AI Model Details

### Current Implementation
- **Architecture**: Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)
- **Input Size**: 224x224x3 RGB images
- **Output**: Binary classification (paralysis/no paralysis)
- **Confidence**: Sigmoid activation for probability scores

### Model Training (For Production)
1. Collect medical dataset of facial images
2. Label images with paralysis/no paralysis
3. Preprocess images (resize, normalize, augment)
4. Train CNN with transfer learning
5. Validate on test set
6. Deploy with proper versioning

## üîí Security & Privacy

### Data Protection
- Images processed temporarily and deleted
- No permanent storage of patient data
- HIPAA-compliant data handling
- Secure API endpoints

### Medical Disclaimer
- AI tool for assistance only
- Not a replacement for professional diagnosis
- Always consult healthcare providers
- Results for informational purposes
