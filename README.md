## 🛠️ Installation

### 1. Clone the Repository
```bash
git clone <repository-url>
cd scanix_2
```

### 2. Backend Setup
```bash

```

## 🚀 Quick Start

### Option 1: Train and Run (Recommended)
```bash
# Train the AI model first
cd backend
python train_model.py

# Start the backend server
python app.py

# In another terminal, start the frontend
flutter run
```

### Option 2: Use Pre-trained Model
```bash
# Start backend (assumes model already exists)
cd backend
python app.py

# Start frontend
flutter run
```

## 📱 Usage

1. **Launch the Application**: Start both backend and frontend
2. **Upload Image**: Take a photo or upload an image of a face
3. **AI Analysis**: The system will analyze facial features for paralysis
4. **View Results**: Get detailed analysis with confidence scores and recommendations
5. **Connect with Doctors**: Access healthcare professionals if needed

## 🔧 API Endpoints
